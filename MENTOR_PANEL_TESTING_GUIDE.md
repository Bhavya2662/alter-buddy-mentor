# üîß Mentor Panel Vercel Deployment Fix & Testing Guide

## üö® **CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED**

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Ably API Key** - Updated from placeholder to actual key: `Fiv44w.ZkTEwA:O54qqKgcU-2KJh6IsbmDVAgf7pi7hNeWl5t72PVnOZI`
2. **Environment Variables** - Added both `REACT_APP_ABLY_KEY` and `REACT_APP_ABLY_API_KEY`
3. **Debug Logging** - Added console logs to verify environment variables in production
4. **Deployment Script** - Created automated fix and deployment process

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Run the Fix Script**
```bash
./fix-vercel-deployment.sh
```

### **Step 2: Verify Vercel Environment Variables**
Go to **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

**Ensure these are set EXACTLY:**
```
REACT_APP_ABLY_API_KEY = Fiv44w.ZkTEwA:O54qqKgcU-2KJh6IsbmDVAgf7pi7hNeWl5t72PVnOZI
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = https://alter-buddy-api-production.up.railway.app/api/1.0
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://alter-buddy-api-production.up.railway.app/api/1.0
REACT_APP_SOCKET_SERVER = https://alter-buddy-api-production.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT = production
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy if Variables Changed**
If you updated any environment variables, trigger a fresh deployment:
- Go to **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy**

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Phase 1: Environment Verification**
- [ ] Open Vercel live URL in Chrome
- [ ] Press **F12 ‚Üí Console**
- [ ] Refresh page and look for **"=== ENVIRONMENT DEBUG ==="** logs
- [ ] Verify all environment variables show correct values
- [ ] Confirm Ably keys show as "Present"

### **Phase 2: API Connectivity**
- [ ] Test API endpoint: `https://alter-buddy-api-production.up.railway.app/api/1.0`
- [ ] Should return API response (not CORS error)
- [ ] Check Network tab for successful API calls

### **Phase 3: Mentor Authentication**
- [ ] Navigate to `/mentor/login`
- [ ] Test mentor login with valid credentials
- [ ] Verify successful authentication and token storage
- [ ] Check for any 401/403 errors in console

### **Phase 4: Mentor Dashboard**
- [ ] Access `/mentor/dashboard` after login
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads completely
- [ ] Check all mentor panel sections are visible
- [ ] Test navigation between mentor pages

### **Phase 5: Mentor Features**
- [ ] **Session Scheduling** - Create/edit time slots
- [ ] **Package Management** - Create/edit packages
- [ ] **Call History** - View past sessions
- [ ] **Profile Management** - Update mentor profile
- [ ] **Real-time Features** - Socket connections work

### **Phase 6: Socket/Ably Integration**
- [ ] Check for Ably connection in Network tab
- [ ] Verify real-time notifications work
- [ ] Test live updates in mentor panel

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Environment Variables Show as 'Missing':**
1. Check Vercel Dashboard environment variables
2. Ensure variables are set for **Production** environment
3. Redeploy after adding missing variables

### **If API Calls Fail (CORS Errors):**
1. Verify backend allows Vercel domain
2. Check Railway backend CORS settings
3. Test API endpoint directly in browser

### **If Mentor Login Fails:**
1. Check console for authentication errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Test with known working mentor credentials

### **If Real-time Features Don't Work:**
1. Verify Ably API key is correct
2. Check Ably connection in Network tab
3. Look for WebSocket connection errors

---

## üìä **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **‚úÖ Deployment is successful when:**
1. All environment variables show "Present" in debug logs
2. Mentor login works without errors
3. Mentor dashboard loads completely
4. All mentor panel features are functional
5. Real-time features work (Ably connections)
6. No console errors related to missing environment variables
7. API calls return 200 status codes

---

## üì∏ **PROOF OF FIX**

**When reporting success, provide:**
1. Screenshot of mentor dashboard working on Vercel URL
2. Console logs showing environment variables are "Present"
3. Network tab showing successful API calls (200 status)
4. Confirmation that all mentor features work as expected

---

## üîÑ **ROLLBACK PLAN**

If issues persist:
1. Revert to previous working deployment
2. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific errors
3. Verify backend API is accessible from Vercel domain
4. Contact backend team to whitelist Vercel domain if needed

---

**üéØ The mentor panel should now work identically on Vercel as it does on localhost!**
